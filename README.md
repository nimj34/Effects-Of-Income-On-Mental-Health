## ðŸ¤· Research Question
"How does income influence suicidality?"

## ðŸ”Ž Hypotheses
1. Lower income leads to higher depression, which in turn leads to suicidal thoughts.
2. Lower income leads to higher depression, which in turn leads to suicide attempts.

## ðŸ“– Variables
The data that I used was collected from the [National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/) (Add Health). This is a longitudinal study that originally took place in five separate waves. For the purposes of this project, however, I focused on Wave III which took place between 2001 and 2002 and Wave IV which took place between 2008 and 2009. 

The final dataset after cleaning and merging both waves had 1659 rows and 24 columns.
